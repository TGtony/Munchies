predict.py
	- The SVM script
	- Make sure that all the svm_model.pk1 files are in the same directory
	- input parameter: string of 1s and 0s (e.g. 10001000100100100....000110)
		- size of the string must be 300 (there are 300 adjectives)
		- make sure order of input for adjectives corresponds to order in model
			- Refer to features_list.txt for which index each adjective corresponds to
				- Take the adjective's line number in .txt -1 and that's its index in the prediction vector
	- output: Returns a string that contains asin results separated by whitespaces
	- to call function in another script: 
		- import predict
		- predict.predict_func( inputstring )
