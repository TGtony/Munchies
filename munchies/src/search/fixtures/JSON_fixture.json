{"model": "search.Product", "pk": "64", "fields": {"asin": "B0000DGG4Y", "title": "Brussel's Trident Maple Forest 9 Tree", "description": "The Trident maple is a Brussel's Bonsai favorite. Five years old, 12 to 16 inches tall, and housed in a shallow blue pot, this bonsai is actually a carefully arranged grove of 9 individual trees. It produces vibrant green foliage in spring, and bright orange leaves in autumn. Attractive foliage and fast growth make this maple one of the most popular deciduous bonsai, and ideal for beginners. Every tree order includes specific growing instructions.Delivery and Packaging: What to expect when you receive your bonsaiTo ensure only well-established, healthy trees are shipped, Brussel's Bonsai imports its trees from nurseries in China where growers spend years training and shaping tree branches. Some bonsai defoliate (drop leaves) when their environment changes. If upon the tree's arrival some leaves have dropped or turned slightly brown that does not mean the bonsai is unhealthy. Defoliation is the natural result of being in the low-light environment of a shipping box. Whenever possible, Brussel&#x92;s Bonsai avoids using Styrofoam-popcorn packaging. In some cases, Styrofoam popcorn must be used to safely pack unusually shaped bonsai. Organic popcorn packaging made from corn starch reacts with moisture from the trees and can dissolve. When you receive your tree, place the box in a shaded area to unpack. Inspect tree for damage to branches or leaves. Water soil if dry. Place each bonsai in protected shade for at least one week before moving to a sunny location.What is a Bonsai?Literally, the Japanese word bonsai means tray tree or plant grown in a pot. The term refers to the artistic techniques used to capture the natural beauty of trees, rather than a specific variety of tree. A full-grown tree and a bonsai can be grown from the same seed--the bonsai has simply been dwarfed and shaped through years of training. To develop authentic bonsai, Brussels grows specimens under carefully controlled conditions, meticulously training each tree with wire and pruning over a period of years. The value of a particular bonsai typically depends on size, age, and training. Generally, more expensive trees are larger, older, and have had more detailed, elaborate training. These qualities combined create the illusion of a large tree in a natural setting.Deciduous/Outdoor Bonsai CareClimateOutdoor bonsai are deciduous trees that require the same climate changes in spring, summer, fall, and winter as full-sized trees of the same species. As a rule, deciduous bonsai do well in regions with humidity levels of 50% to 75% and yearly temperature ranges of 20 to 100 degree F. During winter, deciduous bonsai must remain outdoors. This period of dormancy is essential--without it, the tree may become unhealthy and susceptible to disease. Protect or heel-in your bonsai by covering the pot and soil with pine needles or mulch. Place the tree against a wall to shield it from extreme winds. Outdoor bonsai are more vulnerable to extreme cold than full-size trees and should be moved to a garage, shed, cold frame, or basement when temperatures fall below 20 degrees F.PlacementDeciduous bonsai need to be kept outdoors year-round. Natural sunlight and rainwater are both important elements in an ideal growing environment. Typically, they require six or more hours of direct sunlight a day and do well in locations that get shade from late afternoon sun. Outdoor bonsai may be displayed indoors once a month, for short periods of time (2-3 days). In Japan, bonsai are traditionally displayed against a solid black, white, wood, or bamboo background, or on a stand or pot larger than the tree. Stark contrasts enhance the bonsai&#x92;s simple beauty.WateringGenerally speaking, water when the top of the soil is dry. Use a can or hose attachment that casts a soft, rain-like spray that won&#x92;t disturb the soil in the pot. Do not allow bonsai to dry out. Water daily during hot summer months. In winter, though trees need less water, it&#x92;s a good idea to water well before a hard freeze (frozen water acts as insulation).Soil and fertilizerBonsai trees spend years in the same soil and eventually deplete the available nutrients. Providing supplemental nutrition is essential for a healthy tree. Most water soluble and time-released fertilizers work well when used as directed.Run wire through drainTrim rootballWork soil into rootsRepottingBonsai need to be repotted every 3 to 5 years. After receiving your tree, wait at least one growing season before repotting. Using proper bonsai soil is critical. Brussel&#x92;s bonsai soil consists of a mixture of high-fired clay particles and finely ground pine bark. The soil-free mix does not compact, allows water to drain easily, and helps prevent the root rot that often occurs with ordinary potting soil.It is important to pot your bonsai correctly. Prepare your container for potting by putting screen over the drain holes. Run wire through the drain screen--you will need this to secure the tree in the container. Trim the rootball so it will fit in the bonsai pot. Keep in mind, cutting larger roots is better than cutting small feeder roots. Continue trimming the root ball until it will fit into the bonsai container. Be sure to place a good layer of bonsai soil on the bottom of the bonsai container.Place the tree in the pot. Use the wire to secure the tree in the bonsai container. Twist and pull the wire with pliers to tighten. Add bonsai soil around the root ball. Use a chopstick to work the bonsai soil into the root system. Your bonsai should now be secure in its new container.TrainingAll bonsai require some degree of seasonal pruning. Regular pruning produces smaller branches. A simple pair of pointed-nose scissors does the job. Wiring may also be used to hold them in a desired position or location. If you&#x92;re happy with the branch placement as is, there is no real need to wire. For detailed instruction in the art of pruning bonsai, Brussel&#x92;s Bonsai recommends purchasing a book on basic training techniques.If you choose to wire your bonsai, make sure to use heavier gauge wire for larger branches on the bottom of the tree, and lighter gauge for smaller branches. Begin by sticking the end of the wire into the soil next to the trunk of the tree. Wrap the wire around the trunk until you come to the first branch. Continue curling the wire around the branch. Once you have come to the end of a branch, cut and remove the excess wire. The wire now allows you to bend the branch into the desired shape and location.LifespanMost bonsai trees can live up to 100 years or more depending, of course, on the quality of care they receive.The Story of Brussel's Bonsai NurseryWhen Brussel Martin was five years old, he was instantly captivated by several bonsai his father brought back from a California business trip. As a teenager, he began to seriously study the art of bonsai. What started as an artistic endeavor in his parents' backyard quickly grew into a business. In the 1970s, he began selling bonsai through the mail and traveling to shows across the country. By the early '80s, he was making annual buying trips to Asia.As the business has grown, so has his desire to introduce bonsai to more and more Americans. Brussels now offers a full range of bonsai trees, from modestly priced bonsai for the beginner to unique specimens styled by bonsai experts.", "url": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DlGRUdx7L._SX300_.jpg"}},

Nesco American Harvest's Jerky Spice Works is a way to make six batches of delicious jerky at home at a fraction of the cost of store-bought products. Each box comes with six packets of Cure Mix and six of Spice Mix, enough to turn six pounds of ground meat into long-lasting, high-protein jerky, perfect for camping, hiking, or low-carb snacking. Though beef is very popular for jerky, any ground meat will do: pork, lamb, or even venison and other game meats.Nesco American Harvest Jerky Spice Works is perfect for use in a food dehydrator, which uses air circulation to dry foods quickly and evenly. However, a conventional oven at a low temperature for a slightly longer time will work equally well. Store the finished jerky in a cool, dry place such as the meat or cheese drawer in a refrigerator, or freeze it to extend its shelf life even further. Freeze pork or game meats for at least 30 days at 0 degrees F before drying to make jerky. Cure mix contains nitrite and should be kept away from children. Nesco American Harvest Jerky Spice Works includes a simple, 4-step instruction sheet.--Garland Withers", "url": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51D9FMXMD6L._SX300_.jpg"}},

That&#x92;s why Heart to Heart instant oatmeal has more heart healthy ingredients than any national instant oatmeal to make taking care of your heart easy and enjoyable!Helps Reduce CholesterolHigh cholesterol is one of the major risk factors for heart disease. So we included 1g of soluble fiber from oats in each serving of Heart to Heart instant oatmeal. Soluble fiber combines with water in the digestive tract to help remove cholesterol. In a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, three grams of soluble fiber daily from whole grain oat foods, like Heart to Heart, may reduce the risk of heart disease by helping to lower cholesterol.Helps Support Healthy ArteriesArteries are your body&#x92;s supply lines. That&#x92;s why we added nutrients to help keep your arteries healthy. Heart to Heart instant oatmeal is an excellent source of vitamins E, C, and beta carotene. And, with 25 mg of grape seed extract, you&#x92;re getting the antioxidant benefits of eating nearly a pound of grapes! Green tea extract (100mg) and lycopene from tomato extract (equal to the amount in 1 medium size tomato) are also potent antioxidants. Heart to Heart provides 100% of the daily value for heart healthy vitamins B6, B12 and folic acid, too.Helps Manage HypertensionHypertension, or high blood pressure, is another major risk factor for heart disease. Sodium is important to the body, but a high sodium diet is associated with hypertension. Each serving of Heart to Heart is low in sodium and as part of a low sodium diet may reduce the risk of high blood pressure.", "url": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VVF7YYXTL._SY300_.jpg"}},

Yes, they're actually blue in color because many years ago our founder Al Jacobson bought an entire crop of blue corn (an ancient tradition of the Hopi and Zuni tribes -- people who really know their corn) and thought it would make a great tortilla chip. Was he right! (Al got a lot of things right.) We're proud of the taste and crunchiness of our Blues. But most of all, at Garden of Eatin' we're proud of our tradition of creating the finest in al natural snack foods.We use only the highest quialty organic ingredients. And each batch of chips is made to order. That's what makes Garden of Eatin' snacks so tasty. Garden of Eatin's commitment to selling products made with organic ingredients means understanding that all the decisions we make have consequences -- all the way down to the individual farmers we buy from. We are mindful of the soil, the water, biodiversity and even worker health.Organically Grown. Great Tasting.When Al Jacobson founded Garden of Eatin' over 25 years ago, he knew that buying organic crops from farmers who grew them without pesticides and synthetic fertilizers would be better for your health and for the environment as well. Even our oils are different. They aren't extracted chemically. We crush seeds mechanically in a press. It makes a difference you can taste. And the water. It's not just tap water from a big spigot in the manufacturing", "url": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31CQY7CH6QL.jpg"}},

Founded in 1972, Stash Tea originally operated out of an old Portland Victorian style house, supplying loose herbal teas and bulk herbs to natural food stores. Starting in 1975, the company broadened its focus to include bagged teas and then began to sell a full line of traditional, specialty blend and herbal teas directly to fine restaurants and through a mail-order catalog to consumers. Today, Stash Tea is enjoying steady growth and has become one of the largest specialty tea companies in the United States, with products available through foodservice, grocery stores, tea and coffee shops, club stores, mass merchandisers, natural foods stores, mail order, and the Internet. Stash Tea is also available in Canada and in several foreign countries.The company derives its name from an entertaining aspect of tea folklore. In earlier centuries, tea was a valuable commodity traditionally transported by clipper ship. The ship's captain often was presented with some of the finest teas for his personal use. This supply was his stash, stowed carefully as his private reserve. Today, the term still is used to denote anything put away carefully because of its preciousness.", "url": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZJQMK66ML._SY300_.jpg"}},

Leonard Japp, Jr. turned to his father and asked Do you want to go back to work? To which the elder replied Yeah, why not. So the Japp family reacquired the company in 1994. Jays Foods was born again with the same commitment for quality snacks that has made them the Midwest&#x92;s premier snack manufacturer.Today, Jays manufactures and distributes a full line of quality snacks including its signature Jays Potato Chips, O-KE-DOKE popcorns, Krunchers! Potato Chips, and a line of Hot Stuff snacks. The company has been located in its 99th Street facility on the South Side of Chicago since 1955. If you're passing by, look for the semi-trucks full of potatoes being loaded onto Jays production line.", "url": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DJ3SB2RGL._SY300_.jpg"}},

They have attitude! They're sassy, fresh and appealing, just like the people who enjoy them. Cooked old school--thin and crispy, but with no hydrogenated oils or trans fats--PotatoFinger Potato Chips are a new twist on the classic chip, and a healthier alternative to other snacks.It All Starts with the Perfect PotatoPotatoFinger potato chips are made from natural, authentic chipper potatoes. Chipper potatoes are smaller and rounder than baking potatoes, and with less starch and lower sugar. They require a warm, moist climate to yield the highest quality. (A high starch potato turns brown when baked.) During the regular growing season, we use Atlantis potatoes freshly harvested from fields in the eastern US, starting in Florida, ending in late fall with harvests from Ohio. During the winter months we use Snowder potatoes from a greenhouse in Michigan. The potatoes are grown according to US EPA, USDA, and FDA standards. Neither variety is genetically altered.These Chips Win AwardsIn September 2005, PotatoFinger Old School Thin & Crispy Potato Chips was awarded second place in the best snack category in the Best of Atlanta awards at The Atlanta Gourmet Market. Other accolades include Gold Medal Awards from the American Taste Institute of San Francisco and Superior Product Awards from Food Distribution magazine.", "url": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41GX7EAHHKL._SY300_.jpg"}},

More than 60 small family farmers supply Specialty Cheese Company with their milk every day. Their 110 employees, led by ten Wisconsin licensed cheesemakers, make more than 35 varieties of cheese representing dozens of ethnic traditions. Over the years, our cheesemakers have demonstrated their talents by producing 'grand champion cheeses' of many varieties. In fact, our skilled cheesemakers have trophies that cover the range of traditional cheeses plus our newer, more distinctive varieties.The facts about our company's history are a bit obscured due to the lack of records, we do know that our oldest factory, the Leader plant, has been continuously making cheese for at least 150 years. You see, the earliest real estate deed we can find for the property simply says that when the factory was sold to our predecessors in 1839 it was being used as a 'cheese factory.' That makes the plant the oldest functioning cheese plant in Wisconsin! Our other two plants are comparatively new--they merely date back to the turn of the century.At that time, there were more than 4,000 cheese factories in Wisconsin. Today there are fewer than 150. The company's four plants are among the few that have survived the pressures of change. We have done so by investing in plant improvements (the Leader plant, for instance, is now one of the smallest USDA approved plants in the country) and changing the types of cheese we produce, they say. By applying our cheesemakers' skills to producing new varieties of cheese and constantly seeking to improve our product quality, we have been able to increase our plants' production and double their employment in the past five years.We are proud to continue Wisconsin's tradition of producing the finest cheese to the most exacting standards. We plan to do so with more cheesemaking innovations through the 21st century!", "url": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51D1aZUiqmL._SY300_.jpg"}},

Health Valley's Benefits: Health Valley original Amaranth Graham Crackers are all natural and are made with no genetically engineered ingredients; Made with organic wheat & amaranth; Low fat & low sodium; No hydrogenated oils. The History of Amaranth: When Hernando Cortez led the Spaniards into Mexico, he quickly learned that the wonder grain Amaranth was at the very center of Aztec culture. Amaranth was the most abundant grain the Aztecs grew and the nutritional cornerstone of their diet. So widely was the tiny grain cultivated that each year farmers offered over 200,000 bushels of Amaranth as tribute to their ruler Montezuma. Today, modern science confirms that Amaranth is truly a super grain. Amaranth is rich in lysine, one of the essential amino acids that is usually low in other grains. It contains twice the lysine and iron of wheat, and has more than 12 different vitamins and minerals. From a nutritional standpoint, it is clear why the Aztecs referred to Amaranth as a wonder grain. About Our Company: for over a quarter of a century, Health Valley has insisted on using only the finest natural ingredients - that's why you won't find any artificial colors, flavors, or preservatives in any of our products. We believe that food grown organically - without the use of any artificial pesticides or chemicals - is better for you, your family, and the environment. Organic farming helps keep our food pure and protects our land and water from harmful substances.

Folger was hired by an entrepreneur named William H. Bovee, who needed a carpenter to build a coffee mill in San Francisco, which he called the Pioneer Steam Coffee and Spice Mills. Prior to the Pioneer Steam Coffee and Spice Mills, Californians were purchasing green coffee beans, which they roasted and ground in their homes. Bovee saw an opportunity and inaugurated the production of coffee ready for the pot: roasted, ground, packaged in small tins, and identified by the Pioneer labels. After working at Bovee's mill for close to a year, James had saved enough money to stake a claim and headed out to mine for gold. He agreed to carry along samples of coffee and spices for Bovee, taking orders from grocery stores in the mining country until he arrived in a town called Yankee Jim's in 1851.Upon his return to San Francisco in 1865, James became a full partner of the Pioneer Steam Coffee and Spice Mills. In 1872, James bought out the other partners, renaming the company J.A. Folger & Co. In June 1889, at the age of 51, James passed away and his oldest son, James A. Folger II, stepped into the role of president. Under his leadership, the company expanded dramatically. Its principal product was bulk-roasted coffee, which was delivered to grocery stores in sacks and drums and was stored in bins to be scooped out for the customer. But J.A. Folger & Co. also continued to produce ground coffee.In the 1900s, Folgers & Co. experienced substantial growth, attributable primarily to an energetic salesman named Frank P. Atha. Atha was assigned to sell coffee in the North Beach area of California, where many small grocery stores served the cosmopolitan population. In 1901, after a year on the job, Atha decided that his territory was not large enough for his ambitions. He proposed to Folger that he open and manage a Folgers coffee plant in Texas. Atha's business grew exponentially, and by year two, he was able to hire two more salesmen and rent office space. In 1908, Atha recommended building a new roasting plant in Kansas City, which remains operational to this day.In 1963, the Procter & Gamble Company of Cincinnati, Ohio, acquired the Folgers Coffee Company and began national distribution of the products under the name Folgers. Since P&G; acquired Folgers, it has doubled its business, making it America's number one coffee brand.About Proctor & GambleTwo billion times a day, Proctor & Gamble brands touch the lives of people around the world. The company has one of the largest and strongest portfolios of trusted brands in the world, including Pampers, Tide, Ariel, Always, Pantene, Bounty, Folgers, Pringles, Charmin, Downy, Iams, Crest, Actonel, and Olay.It all started in 1837 when William Procter and James Gamble settled in Cincinnati. Procter quickly established himself as a candle maker, while Gamble apprenticed himself to a soap maker. The two might never have met had they not married sisters, Olivia and Elizabeth Norris, whose father convinced his new sons-in-law to become business partners. In 1837,a bold new enterprise was born: Procter & Gamble. By each pledging $3,596.47 to the new venture, they began selling soap and candles. Twenty-two years later, their business exceeded $1 million in sales. By 1980 that figure would reach $10 billion, and by 1993 the company would generate over $35 billion in revenue.", "url": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FBV80ARYL._SY300_.jpg"}},

When Betty Lou started looking for treats for her children to take to school, she realized how difficult it was to find treats that were not made with refined sugar--so she set about creating her own recipes. Having never created recipes before, she began to experiment, throwing in crunchy peanut butter, a bit of honey, nuts seed, and oats. Her experiments worked: Betty Lou's new snacks caught on, and today they are produced and marketed under Betty Lou's, Inc. In addition to her original butter balls, Betty Lou's also produces granola, cookies, vegan bars, and a variety of gluten-free or dairy-free products--all made without refined sugar. Betty Lou's products make a naturally nutty snack with coffee for breakfast, or even a quick, healthy lunch. Athletes have been known to buy them for a nutritious boost of energy during training.

Wylde, founder of Sam Wylde Flour Co., in 1962, Ener-G Foods has evolved to become one of the largest producers devoted to special diet foods in the United States.Our mission at Ener-G Foods, as one of the country's foremost producers of foods for diet-restricted individuals, is to provide a wide range of ready-made foods and mixes that are wholesome, nutritious, risk free, and good tasting. We are constantly responding to the demand for special diets with research, innovative products, and convenience foods.Since 1962, when we first created low-protein products for renal pre-dialysis patients, we have striven to meet the challenging requirements for diet restricted consumers. We not only offer wheat-free, gluten-free products, but also products for low-protein diets, egg-free, and dairy-free products. Our bakery is dedicated to wheat-free, gluten-free baking, guaranteeing that contamination from gluten will not occur. Our innovative packaging gives our products a 1-year shelf life without the need for refrigeration. We bake our products as orders are received to insure that the freshest product is available.How we got to where we are today.In 1887, Sam M. Wylde's grandfather started the first flourmill in Seattle. It was built to supply export flour to the orient as well as supply flour to the people of Washington State. After World War I, Sam M. Wylde's father and uncles joined the family business and learned the milling industry. Meanwhile, Sam Wylde traveled the country and the world working at everything from elevator salesman to a ships' steward. Returning to Seattle after World War II, Sam Wylde was one of the founders of Brodie Restaurant and Hotel Supply, but when Sam's father took ill, he left Brodie to help run the family mill.When Sam Wylde's father died, his uncles, Norman and Alan, decided to close the mill. Unemployed, Sam Wylde started Sam Wylde Flour Co. to distribute flour and bakery items to local bakeries. The fleet of trucks bearing Sam Wylde's name ranged all over Western Washington, from the Canadian border to as far south as Southern California. Fisher Mills, Inc, bought Sam Wylde Flour Co., of Seattle. Fisher Mills later sold Sam Wylde Flour Mills to a Dutch company, Puratos. Puratos has changed the name of Sam Wylde Flour Mills to Puratos. Fisher Mills no longer exists.When Sam Wylde purchased Ener-G Foods, Inc. in 1962, we were little more than a two-person operation in which all packing was done by hand. Shortly after acquiring Ener-G Foods, Sam was approached by Dr. Scribner of the University of Washington. Dr. Scribner, known worldwide as the father of dialysis, is credited with inventing what we commonly call the kidney machine.Meeting with Dr. Scribner and his dietitian, Sondra Aker, they explained that there was an acute shortage of dialysis machines and they desperately needed a low protein bread. The University of Washington had one dialysis machine for thousands of kidney patients. Since the kidneys convert protein to uric acid, if the protein intake were restricted, the kidneys would not have to work so hard, hence would require less frequent dialysis.Sam Wylde and Ener-G Foods worked on low-protein bread for about a year before arriving at an acceptable result. Made with a base of wheat starch it was low in protein, sodium, potassium and phosphorus, therefore acceptable for a low-protein diet. It was also discovered that by restricting protein intake, progression of renal failure could be slowed even for patients on the dialysis unit.Sometime later, Dr. Cyrus Rubin, inventor of the Rubin Biopsy Tube and professor of Gastroenterology at the University of Washington, sent his dietitian to us with a request for a gluten-free bread with one restriction, I don't want any wheat starch. Also at about the same time, Sam Wylde, Sr., developed prostrate cancer and Sam Wylde, III, having completed his MBA in Oregon, moved back to Seattle to assist his father with both Ener-G Foods and Sam Wylde Flour Co. Sam Wylde, III, began working nights on developing gluten-free breads and other products without the use of wheat starch.", "url": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Y2J92XNPL._SY300_.jpg"}},

Shortly after acquiring Ener-G Foods, Sam was approached by Dr. Scribner of the University of Washington. Dr. Scribner, known worldwide as the father of dialysis, is credited with inventing what we commonly call the kidney machine.Meeting with Dr. Scribner and his dietitian, Sondra Aker, they explained that there was an acute shortage of dialysis machines and they desperately needed a low protein bread. The University of Washington had one dialysis machine for thousands of kidney patients. Since the kidneys convert protein to uric acid, if the protein intake were restricted, the kidneys would not have to work so hard, hence would require less frequent dialysis.Sam Wylde and Ener-G Foods worked on low-protein bread for about a year before arriving at an acceptable result. Made with a base of wheat starch it was low in protein, sodium, potassium and phosphorus, therefore acceptable for a low-protein diet. It was also discovered that by restricting protein intake, progression of renal failure could be slowed even for patients on the dialysis unit.Sometime later, Dr. Cyrus Rubin, inventor of the Rubin Biopsy Tube and professor of Gastroenterology at the University of Washington, sent his dietitian to us with a request for a gluten-free bread with one restriction, I don't want any wheat starch.

Purchased by Sam M. Wylde, founder of Sam Wylde Flour Co., in 1962, Ener-G Foods has evolved to become one of the largest producers devoted to special diet foods in the United States.Our mission at Ener-G Foods, as one of the country's foremost producers of foods for diet-restricted individuals, is to provide a wide range of ready-made foods and mixes that are wholesome, nutritious, risk free, and good tasting. We are constantly responding to the demand for special diets with research, innovative products, and convenience foods.Since 1962, when we first created low-protein products for renal pre-dialysis patients, we have striven to meet the challenging requirements for diet restricted consumers. We not only offer wheat-free, gluten-free products, but also products for low-protein diets, egg-free, and dairy-free products. Our bakery is dedicated to wheat-free, gluten-free baking, guaranteeing that contamination from gluten will not occur. Our innovative packaging gives our products a 1-year shelf life without the need for refrigeration. We bake our products as orders are received to insure that the freshest product is available.How we got to where we are today.In 1887, Sam M. Wylde's grandfather started the first flourmill in Seattle. It was built to supply export flour to the orient as well as supply flour to the people of Washington State. After World War I, Sam M. Wylde's father and uncles joined the family business and learned the milling industry. Meanwhile, Sam Wylde traveled the country and the world working at everything from elevator salesman to a ships' steward. Returning to Seattle after World War II, Sam Wylde was one of the founders of Brodie Restaurant and Hotel Supply, but when Sam's father took ill, he left Brodie to help run the family mill.When Sam Wylde's father died, his uncles, Norman and Alan, decided to close the mill. Unemployed, Sam Wylde started Sam Wylde Flour Co. to distribute flour and bakery items to local bakeries. The fleet of trucks bearing Sam Wylde's name ranged all over Western Washington, from the Canadian border to as far south as Southern California.

Mariani, Sr., an immigrant from the Mediterranean region known for growing fruit, arrived in California and started Mariani Packing Co., Inc. The beginnings were humble with the family growing most of its own fruit and packing it into wooden boxes for export markets.In the early 1940s, his son, Paul A. Mariani, Jr., developed, for the first time, a moist dried fruit product that did not have to be rehydrated at home. Through this innovation, the business grew and perfected working partnerships with major supermarkets throughout the country.In 1979, Paul Mariani Sr.'s grandson, Mark A. Mariani, became responsible for its legacy. From the company's solid foundation, he has grown the business and the company now sells more than 125 million pounds of product annually. It is a dominant brand for quality dried fruit in the retail sector of supermarkets and is also known for the premium ingredients it sells to Fortune 500 companies. 2006 marks the 100th anniversary of Paul Mariani&#x92;s humble beginnings. Today, four generations later, the Mariani Packing Company is still family owned and operated and has grown to become the largest independent dried fruit producer in the world.The company has its home office in Vacaville, Calif., with four other processing sites throughout California, the largest having 18 acres under roof. The family continues to follow the vision set by Paul A. Mariani, Sr. with Mark A. Mariani as Chairman/CEO and great grandson, George Sousa, Jr., as President. They are committed to the early lessons of their predecessors:Mutual RespectEmbrace ChangeContinuous ImprovementNever Compromise on QualityBuild for the Future", "url": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515RZR98K5L._SY300_.jpg"}},

As a matter of fact, we&#x92;ve got the best-selling jerky in all of North America and the fastest growing in the world. Not bad for a family business based in Minong, Wisconsin, population 521. We&#x92;re smack dab in the middle of the great Northwoods &#x96; somewhere between where the heck are we and God&#x92;s country. It&#x92;s the kind of place where flannel&#x92;s good enough for Sunday, and coffee only comes one way--black. Around here, there is fresh clean air, lots of trees, good fishing and hunting. If we didn&#x92;t already live here, it would be a great place to get away from it all.So, how did a guy from Minong start making beef jerky? Well, it came to me one day when my boys and I were headed out to the woods for an afternoon hunt. We stopped at a local store for snacks and bought some jerky out of the glass jar on the counter. Turned out to be about as tough as our hunting boots. It was clear to me that whoever made that tough jerky cut the meat the wrong way. You see, I know all about cutting beef, since my family&#x92;s been in the meat business since the 1890s.Well, the boys and I went back home and found my great-grandfather&#x92;s original recipes. The paper was yellowed, but the recipes were as good as the day they were written. We decided to try our hand at making jerky the genuine, authentic way. It turned out even better than we could have hoped for.It didn&#x92;t take long for us to decide to share our jerky with the rest of the folks in the area. We started selling our Jack Link&#x92;s Jerky out of the back of my truck from one mom-and-pop store to the next. Pretty soon, it was nearly impossible to keep up. Folks just couldn&#x92;t get enough of our jerky. So we geared up to make more. And more. And more. Instead of just sharing our jerky with folks around here, we started sharing it with the world--adding new flavors, new textures and new sizes. In fact, I like to think we changed the way people think about jerky. They&#x92;re just not willing to settle for jerky as tough as an old hunting boot anymore.Even with all the changes over the years, the important things have stayed the same.

As a matter of fact, we&#x92;ve got the best-selling jerky in all of North America and the fastest growing in the world. Not bad for a family business based in Minong, Wisconsin, population 521. We&#x92;re smack dab in the middle of the great Northwoods &#x96; somewhere between where the heck are we and God&#x92;s country. It&#x92;s the kind of place where flannel&#x92;s good enough for Sunday, and coffee only comes one way--black. Around here, there is fresh clean air, lots of trees, good fishing and hunting. If we didn&#x92;t already live here, it would be a great place to get away from it all.So, how did a guy from Minong start making beef jerky? Well, it came to me one day when my boys and I were headed out to the woods for an afternoon hunt. We stopped at a local store for snacks and bought some jerky out of the glass jar on the counter. Turned out to be about as tough as our hunting boots. It was clear to me that whoever made that tough jerky cut the meat the wrong way. You see, I know all about cutting beef, since my family&#x92;s been in the meat business since the 1890s.Well, the boys and I went back home and found my great-grandfather&#x92;s original recipes. The paper was yellowed, but the recipes were as good as the day they were written. We decided to try our hand at making jerky the genuine, authentic way. It turned out even better than we could have hoped for.It didn&#x92;t take long for us to decide to share our jerky with the rest of the folks in the area. We started selling our Jack Link&#x92;s Jerky out of the back of my truck from one mom-and-pop store to the next. Pretty soon, it was nearly impossible to keep up. Folks just couldn&#x92;t get enough of our jerky. So we geared up to make more. And more. And more. Instead of just sharing our jerky with folks around here, we started sharing it with the world--adding new flavors, new textures and new sizes. In fact, I like to think we changed the way people think about jerky. They&#x92;re just not willing to settle for jerky as tough as an old hunting boot anymore.Even with all the changes over the years, the important things have stayed the same.

As a matter of fact, we&#x92;ve got the best-selling jerky in all of North America and the fastest growing in the world. Not bad for a family business based in Minong, Wisconsin, population 521. We&#x92;re smack dab in the middle of the great Northwoods &#x96; somewhere between where the heck are we and God&#x92;s country. It&#x92;s the kind of place where flannel&#x92;s good enough for Sunday, and coffee only comes one way--black. Around here, there is fresh clean air, lots of trees, good fishing and hunting. If we didn&#x92;t already live here, it would be a great place to get away from it all.So, how did a guy from Minong start making beef jerky? Well, it came to me one day when my boys and I were headed out to the woods for an afternoon hunt. We stopped at a local store for snacks and bought some jerky out of the glass jar on the counter. Turned out to be about as tough as our hunting boots. It was clear to me that whoever made that tough jerky cut the meat the wrong way. You see, I know all about cutting beef, since my family&#x92;s been in the meat business since the 1890s.Well, the boys and I went back home and found my great-grandfather&#x92;s original recipes. The paper was yellowed, but the recipes were as good as the day they were written. We decided to try our hand at making jerky the genuine, authentic way. It turned out even better than we could have hoped for.It didn&#x92;t take long for us to decide to share our jerky with the rest of the folks in the area. We started selling our Jack Link&#x92;s Jerky out of the back of my truck from one mom-and-pop store to the next. Pretty soon, it was nearly impossible to keep up. Folks just couldn&#x92;t get enough of our jerky. So we geared up to make more. And more. And more.

About the Brand: I started baking and selling cookies at 9 years old and loved it so much I decided to make it my life&#x2019;s work and yes my last name really is Baker! It all began in 1994 when I rented the 4-H kitchen at the Whidbey Island Fairgrounds to bake my way to a better life. Inspired by my mom&#x2019;s healthy baking and armed with a KitchenAid mixer, I created a revolutionary new way to serve breakfast the Breakfast Cookie was born! For the last 17 years, oats, fruit & honey have been the staple ingredients in my bakery, making us unique in our efforts to provide healthier food products. I take great pride in baking products with whole food ingredients which provide sustained energy and optimal nutrition. Over the years I have created many wonderful recipes to share with my loyal following. My Breakfast Cookies, Homestyle Granola, Breakfast Cookie Minis and Organic Brownie Bites are handcrafted and baked to order, promising homemade freshness and flavor. Simple, wholesome baking principles inspired me when I was a little girl. They still make perfect sense now that I am grown up! Bake with purpose, bake fresh to order, bake with healthy and wholesome ingredients. It&#x2019;s that simple.

Four years later, I have never looked back and have never eaten better! I first started by hand-slicing small batches of fresh New England potatoes into a small French-fry cooker I borrowed from a friend with a restaurant. I experimented for months testing different oils, potatoes and seasoned toppings. My plan was simple; not to give up until I had discovered the point at which perfect flavor merged with a healthy, simple recipe. Eventually, I found that perfect recipe: Select North American potatoes cooked in pure high-monounsaturated canola oil and topped with only all natural spices, herbs and sea salt. Nothing artificial is used, ever - only simple, premium, healthful and naturally delicious ingredients go into making our chips. Life became a Madhouse from that point on! As word got out about our recipes, our popularity among chip connoisseurs grew at a frantic pace. While we have been copied and shoved-around by the Big Guys in the chip world, they just can't seem to get it right, and for now, our unique micro-chips are, alone, at the top. I certainly hope that you enjoy Madhouse Munchies as much as we do. Enjoy! Jim Ehlen, Founder", "url": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51P5aHAOjOL._SY300_.jpg"}},

This is why nuts like cashews are a great way to fill that void because like all nuts, cashews are packed with vitamins and minerals. Cashews get their rich buttery taste because of the 13g of fat per serving. This is not bad news because most the fat is healthy unsaturated fat that our bodies need. That one serving of cashews will get you 7.6g of monounsaturated fat and 2.2g of polyunsaturated fat. Even better, cashews will make you heart healthy with fatty acids of omega-3 and omega-6 loaded into every serving of delicious cashews.", "url": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41FxHAj-e1L._SY300_.jpg"}},

Each member of the family is sure to have a favorite so be sure to stock your pantry. About the Brand: I started baking and selling cookies at 9 years old and loved it so much I decided to make it my life&#x2019;s work.and yes my last name really is Baker. It all began in 1994 when I rented the 4-H kitchen at the Whidbey Island Fairgrounds to bake my way to a better life. Inspired by my mom&#x2019;s healthy baking and armed with a KitchenAid mixer, I created a revolutionary new way to serve breakfast, the Breakfast Cookie was born. For the last 17 years, oats, fruit & honey have been the staple ingredients in my bakery, making us unique in our efforts to provide healthier food products. I take great pride in baking products with whole food ingredients which provide sustained energy and optimal nutrition. Over the years I have created many wonderful recipes to share with my loyal following. My Breakfast Cookies, Homestyle Granola, Breakfast Cookie Minis and Organic Brownie Bites are handcrafted and baked to order, promising homemade freshness and flavor. Simple, wholesome baking principles inspired me when I was a little girl. They still make perfect sense now that I am grown up! Bake with purpose, bake fresh to order, bake with healthy and wholesome ingredients. It&#x2019;s that simple.

Glee Gum is the only gum in North America made the old fashioned way, with chicle! Chicle is a natural tree sap harvested sustainably from the rainforests of Central America. Once all chewing gum was made with chicle, but today most gum is made entirely from synthetic stuff. Not Glee Gum! Glee Gum uses chicle because it helps conserve the rainforest. Chicle is also what gives the gum such great, long-lasting chewing texture! Glee Gum is a &#x201C;green&#x201D; gum right down to the packaging, which is made from biodegradable, recycled cardboard.

Sugar Free Enchantments are thoughtfully blended with non-traditional, wholesome ingredients to support a controlled carbohydrate lifestyle and contribute to an overall healthy and balanced diet. Our sugar free, low carbohydrate cookies are baked to be the ultimate reward. Diabetic exchanges: 1 Cookie (=) 1/2 carbohydrates (+) 1+1/2 fat. How to Calculate Net Carbs: Total Carbohydrates 10.7 g.

Enter preserved truffles. These are not as pungent or flavorful as the fresh kind, however, at a much more accessible price, they do allow you to experiment with truffle recipes. Summer truffles will not be very striking out of the jar, or have much aroma or flavor if used raw. Rather, you need to coax the flavors out, and they will need to be heated up or cooked with to bring out the flavors. Best for used in hot dishes like risottos, omelettes and mashed potatoes. The heat of the dish itself will help bring out the aromas. Preserved truffles are a nice, budget-friendly way to add visual truffle appeal to dishes.

Jarred or canned truffles, sold by us or any other vendor, are mere shadows of their fresh truffle selves and will not, by themselves, deliver the aroma or flavor of fresh truffles.

Health Valley's Benefits: Health Valley original Amaranth Graham Crackers are all natural and are made with no genetically engineered ingredients; Made with organic wheat & amaranth; Low fat & low sodium; No hydrogenated oils. The History of Amaranth: When Hernando Cortez led the Spaniards into Mexico, he quickly learned that the wonder grain Amaranth was at the very center of Aztec culture. Amaranth was the most abundant grain the Aztecs grew and the nutritional cornerstone of their diet. So widely was the tiny grain cultivated that each year farmers offered over 200,000 bushels of Amaranth as tribute to their ruler Montezuma. Today, modern science confirms that Amaranth is truly a super grain. Amaranth is rich in lysine, one of the essential amino acids that is usually low in other grains. It contains twice the lysine and iron of wheat, and has more than 12 different vitamins and minerals. From a nutritional standpoint, it is clear why the Aztecs referred to Amaranth as a wonder grain.

Currently, Haribo operates five factories in Germany and 13 throughout the rest of Europe. The company also has sales offices in almost every country in Europe as well as in the Unites States.

The early Indians would dry venison, buffalo and elk meat. Some would rub berries on the meat and let it dry in the sun to create Pemmican jerky. The early trappers and explorers would build smoke huts and hang cuts of meat over a fire. The smoke would cure and the heat dry the meat. Every family had their own recipe for smoked meat. Jerky was created when the meat would be cut into strips, flavored and then cured. Stripping the meat from the carcass into pieces allowed for different size cuts to be made into jerky. Some of these cuts would have not been able to be used if they were not preserved.

Xylitol is a five-carbon sugar alcohol that has nearly identical taste and bulk to table sugar (sucrose), but with amazing dental benefits!nnNot only does it have fewer calories and less effect on blood sugar than sucrose, but it also has the added benefit of inhibiting the creation of acid in the mouth. This minimizes the damage done to your teeth, as well as allowing your teeth to heal (remineralize) at a faster rate. Xylitol also has a low glycemic index of 7, compared to sugar's level of 83.nnIt is recommended that you chew a piece of xylitol gum after every meal or snack for maximum benefit to your teeth as it may reduce the risk of decay in the tooth. Xylitol is recommended by dentist, medical doctors, periodontists, pediatricians, and many health organizations and health professionals worldwide as a sweetener for anyone concerned with dental health, upper respiratory health, and sugar consumption, in general.nnProducts sweetened with xylitol create an unwelcome environment for bacteria; study after study has shown that they simply do not stick well to teeth in a xylitol-rich environment.", "url": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41YEZbs446L._SX300_.jpg"}},

The brand's unique name was trademarked after one of its salesmen ate the product and exclaimed That's a Cracker Jack! The process for keeping the molasses-covered popcorn morsels from sticking together was discovered in 1896---and is a secret formula still in use today. The CRACKER JACK&#xAB; brand has a rich history. It is immortalized in the song, Take Me Out to the Ball Game, which was written in 1908 by two men who never saw a baseball game until years after they had composed their baseball anthem. Sailor Jack&#xAB; and his dog, Bingo&#xAB;, have been on CRACKER JACK&#xAB; brand packages since 1918 when the founder's young grandson was the model for Sailor Jack&#xAB;. CRACKER JACK&#xAB; brand introduced a prize-in-every-box in 1912 when toys were first inserted into every package--a tradition that continues today. CRACKER JACK&#xAB; is a product of Frito Lay, the world's leader in convenient foods and a division of PepsiCo.", "url": "http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-site/icons/no-img-sm._CB192198896_.gif"}},

But thanks to us, you can now get the ice cream astronauts eat without the risk of accidentally learning anything. Yay!nnEach package of Astronaut Ice Cream is made with state-of-the-art yummy food technology. First made by the Whirlpool Corporation (yup, the washer/dryer people) for the Apollo missions, freeze dried ice cream has been a favorite of geeks ever since. We have three flavors to offer you. The original flavor most often found in museums is neapolitan (chocolate, strawberry, and vanilla) - and we also have mint chocolate chip (cool and delicious) and chocolate chocolate chip (very, very chocolaty) to tease your taste buds. Try one or try them all, we know you'll love 'em. And if you really want the full astronaut experience, just get some tall strong folks at your office to hold you upside down when you eat.

Chefs have always used a balsamic glaze to finish their plates and flavor their dishes, but lets face it, few of us home cooks have the time or patience to prepare it at home. When you reduce good balsamic vinegar, the result is a concentrated flavor with a syrupy consistency. The difficult part of the process is the actual time for the reduction process. Well, the hard work is done for you with this special Acetum Glaze.Acetum Blazes are a perfect condiment to use to get your children to try vegetables or any other food. Vince Jr., Ditalia's owner, gives his daughter Balsamic Blaze to dip her vegetables, bread, meats, fish and chicken. Vince's daughter rarely asks for ketchup anymore! This is a perfect condiment to open up the gourmet world and unique flavors to children!", "url": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61p-Vm2M2UL._SY300_.jpg"}},

All you need are a few drops of white truffle oil to imbue a dish with the mysterious taste and aroma of truffle. The oil's intensity is lessened if cooked, so drizzle it over finished dishes like bean dips or soups, pizza, risotto, mashed potatoes, or roasted vegetables.
